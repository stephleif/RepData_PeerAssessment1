#The image files are in PA1_template_files/figure-html/# 
On my machine the figures were placed in ./PA1_template_files 
I did not set any parameters to make this happen - it was the default. 
The instructions said to put them in figures but the generated html code is looking for a data structure like this:

blokquote PA1_template_files/figure-html/

All the images are in the figure-html directory which is a subdirectory under PA1_template_files.
I expect this is a change in knitr from when the assignment was first created.
